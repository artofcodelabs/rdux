# Rdux

Rdux is a Rails plugin.  

This library provides your application with audit logs.  
Rdux gives the Rails app an ability to store in the database sanitized input data (**action name** âž• **payload**) as the `Rdux::Action`.  
**Action** is a PORO whose `call` or `up` method takes the **payload** as the argument.   
Use `meta` to save additional data like `current_user.id`, etc.  
Use `up_result` to store DB changes, IDs of created records, responses from 3rd parties etc.  

Rdux is a minimal take on event sourcing.

Rdux provides support for reverting actions ðŸ‘‰ down  

organically introduces 2 layers: actions and queries  

unifies the type of payload ðŸ‘‰ no more with_indifferent_access  

saves failed and nested actions  

~It makes it easy to trace when, where, why, and how your application's state changed.
